        <p>
          Deep within the vast cosmic expanse, black holes have long held the enigmatic allure of being some of the most mysterious objects in the universe. However, in the 1970s, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking made a groundbreaking discovery that shattered our conventional understanding of black holes. He proposed a phenomenon known as "Hawking radiation." This unexpected radiation suggests that black holes aren't truly black; they emit a faint glow, leading to their slow but inevitable evaporation. In this blog post, we'll delve into the fascinating world of Hawking radiation, exploring its origins, implications, and the profound impact it has had on our understanding of the universe.
